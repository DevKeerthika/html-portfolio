<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Keerthika Java Enthusiast | Aspiring Full Stack Web Developer

  Hi, I'm Keerthika! I'm a recent Master's graduate in Computer Science and Engineering with a passion for Java development, SQL, HTML, and CSS. 
  With a strong foundation in Core Java, JDBC, Servlets, and Hibernate, I'm excited to apply my skills to real-world projects. 
  When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, listening to music, meditating, drawing, or cooking. I'm a proactive learner looking to collaborate with dynamic teams and drive innovation in the industry.</p>
